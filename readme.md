# Codeivate signature generator code

A slightly modifed version of this code is used to generate user signature on the [codeivate.com](www.codeivate.com)
A signature can be generated by placing /signature.png on the end of your username URL and placing it in a HTML img tag.

These can be used for forum signatures, email signatures, or embeded in your site.

The live site version _does not_ support GET variables, it gets data from a database.
